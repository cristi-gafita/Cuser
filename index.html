<p>CuSEr (Customer Smart Entertainer) is a single page application (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>) for a restaurant that wants to create a new smart social experience for its customers by making use of different social networks and semantic Web technologies. CuSEr creates such an experience which offers customers various entertainment facilities like comics, funny videos, electronic/real games or jokes while waiting for drinks/meals. Also, several collaborative interaction games with other people (i.e. those having similar gastronomical tastes) from the same food establishment may be suggested. This application also offers a multi-language user experience.</p>

<a id="technologies" class="anchor" href="#technologies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technologies</h1>

<p>All the technologies used in this project are used in real-life application and are considered top of the line.The main technologies used are : </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJs</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">WebApi</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.dotnetrdf.org/">dotNetRDF</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> </li>
<li>
<a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> </li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx">Entity Framework</a>      </p>

<p>The front-end is built in AngularJs using a multi-layered service architecture to be easily maintained and respect best practices.In order to easily implement themes in the application but also because it is a newer alternative than CSS less was chosen.The design of the project was built using the popular framework Bootstrap.   </p>

<p>The back-end is built using Microsoft technologies so the REST Api is implemented using WebApi, also to comunicate with the database Entity Framework was used.   </p>

<p>Taking into account that the project is built using mostly .NET technologies dotNetRDF was the obvious choice in order to easily work with RDF, SPARQL and the Semantic Web.   </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="architecture" class="anchor" href="#architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Architecture</h1>

<p>The application has a multi-layered architecture on both front-end and back-end.Both architectures obey best practices so that the code respects SOLID and REST principles and also that the code is easy to manage and maintain.</p>

<h2>
<a id="front-end" class="anchor" href="#front-end" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Front-end</h2>

<p><img src="https://cuser2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/arhitectura-front-end.png" alt="Front-End Architecture"></p>

<p>The front-end architecture consists of three layers of services as seen in the diagram above.The first service is the configuration service and it has only one responsibility, to provide URLs to the exposed methods of the Web API. The second layer consists of the synchronization service that makes the actual calls to the Web API, this services takes the required url from the configuration service, gets the data from the entity services and makes the call to the Web API. The third layer of services consists of multiple entity services, each entity having it's own service thus obeying the single responsibility principle, any processing of the data, that can be done on the front-end is done inside this service and not in the angular controllers or in the other services.     </p>

<p>The angular controllers are as light as possible with as little logic as possible, where heavy logic is required directives are used.    </p>

<h2>
<a id="back-end" class="anchor" href="#back-end" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Back-end</h2>

<p><img src="https://cuser2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/backenddiagram.png" alt="Back-End Architecture"></p>

<p>The back-end is built around .NET technologies and has four layers.The first layer is represented by the actual database model (internal and external).The second layer is represented by the repositories, the next layer unifies the external and internal data,in here is where the most back-end logic lies as well.The final layer is represented by the WEB API controllers that expose services to the front-end.</p>

<h3>
<a id="web-api" class="anchor" href="#web-api" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web API</h3>

<p>The Web API is the final layer of the back-end and the layer that exposes data to the front-end.So far the controllers that are considered as needed are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Account</li>
<li>User</li>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Recommendation</li>
</ul>

<p>More will be added once the actual implementation of the application begins.</p>

<h3>
<a id="internal-data-models" class="anchor" href="#internal-data-models" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internal data models</h3>

<p>The database used for internal data will be sql server.The data will be translated into models using entity framework.The models needed to implement this application are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Account</li>
<li>User</li>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Dish</li>
<li>Ingredient</li>
<li>Recommendation</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>

Use HTTP GET to retrieve what you want (read on below for more details). Results can returned as raw JSON data (the default case) or using a JavaScript callback function for script communication.</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="food-endpoints" class="anchor" href="#food-endpoints" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Food Endpoints:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Endpoint: <a href="http://spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.mashape.com/">http://spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.mashape.com/</a> Descripiton: The Food API is Spoonacular's Food, Recipe, and Nutrition API which allows users to access over 330,000 recipes and 80,000 food products. The API has a food ontology that makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language (such as "gluten free brownies without sugar"). Users can visualize recipe nutrition and ingredient lists, analyze recipe costs, find recipes by nutritional requirements, favorite ingredients, or what's in the fridge, classify recipes, convert ingredient amounts, and even compute an entire meal plan. </li>
</ul>

<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>CuSEr is an application that uses the latest technologies and uses architectures that are used in real-life applications. Because no deprecated technologies were used continued support for these technologies is assured for many years to come.</p>
